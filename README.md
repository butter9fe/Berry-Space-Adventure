## Description
Small project made in ~5 days for an introductory programming project.
Physics-based game using pure vanilla Python. Only libraries used were standard Python libraries: Tkinter for GUI and PyQT5 for sound. 
As such, this project can be ran out-of-the-box without any installations.

Everything else is made from scratch including a custom Physics system.
